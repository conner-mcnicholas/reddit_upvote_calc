# Reddit Post Nominal Upvote/Downvote Calculator
 
Posts on reddit are given a score, calculated as upvotes less downvotes, and the analytics include an "Upvote Rate" percentage.  But there is no view of the nominal number of upvotes and downvotes.

The relationships between a posts score and upvote raet  allow us to solve for the nominal values by setting up two equations with two variables (upvotes & downvotes), and solving for them via substitution.

To run the calculator, enter `./run` and follow the prompts.  Your results will print to stdout:
