Normally, these two metrics would allow us to solve for the nominal upvotes and downvotes simply by setting up two equations with two variables and solving via substitution.

However, this is not feasible Because the Upvote Rate shown is rounded off to the nearest integer.

Instead, we can look at different combinations of upvotes and downvote that yield the shown Score, and take the pair that most closely yields the Upvote Rate
